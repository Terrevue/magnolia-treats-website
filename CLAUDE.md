## 📋 Current Status: IN PROGRESS - Setting up TinaCMS

We are **90% complete** with the website setup. Currently setting up a content management system (CMS) so Mia (non-technical user) can edit the website herself.

---

## 🚧 Current Task: Complete TinaCMS Setup

### What TinaCMS Does
TinaCMS provides a visual editing interface at `/admin` where Mia can:
- Edit all website text (hero, about, cookies, contact)
- Add/remove/edit cookie treats with images
- Upload weekly comic strips
- Changes auto-commit to GitHub and rebuild the site
- **NO CODING REQUIRED**

### Why We're Stuck
TinaCMS requires a free cloud account to authenticate GitHub access. The build fails with:
```
Error: Client not configured properly. Missing clientId, token
```

### What's Needed to Continue

**OPTION A: Complete TinaCMS Setup (Recommended)**

1. **Create TinaCMS Cloud Account:**
   - Go to: https://app.tina.io/register
   - Sign up with GitHub account (Terrevue)

2. **Create TinaCMS Project:**
   - Click "New Project" in Tina dashboard
   - Connect repository: `Terrevue/magnolia-treats-website`
   - Select branch: `main`

3. **Get Credentials:**
   - Copy **Client ID** (looks like: `abc123xyz...`)
   - Copy **Read-only Token** (looks like: `tok_...`)

4. **Add to Netlify Environment Variables:**
   - URL: https://app.netlify.com/sites/magnoliatreats/settings/env
   - Add variable: `TINA_CLIENT_ID` = [paste client ID]
   - Add variable: `TINA_TOKEN` = [paste token]

5. **Update Build Command on Netlify:**
   - URL: https://app.netlify.com/sites/magnoliatreats/settings/deploys
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `./`

6. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete TinaCMS setup"
   git push
   ```

7. **Access Admin:**
   - Go to: https://magnoliatreats.netlify.app/admin
   - Log in with GitHub
   - Edit content!

**OPTION B: Simple Alternative (No Cloud Service)**

If TinaCMS cloud setup is too complex, we can create a simpler solution:
- GitHub web-based JSON editor
- Teach Mia to edit JSON files directly in GitHub
- Still no HTML/CSS knowledge required
- Just edit text in simple files

## 📝 Notes for Future Claude Sessions

### File Locations
- Main HTML: `/Users/chris/Dropbox/Mia/Magnolia Treats/website/index.html`
- Content files: `/Users/chris/Dropbox/Mia/Magnolia Treats/website/content/*.json`
- TinaCMS config: `/Users/chris/Dropbox/Mia/Magnolia Treats/website/tina/config.js`

### Netlify CLI
- Authenticated and working
- Linked to site already
- Can deploy with: `netlify deploy --prod`

### MCP Servers Configured
- Netlify MCP: Installed but needs authentication
- Command: `claude mcp list` to check status

### Important Decisions Made
1. Chose Netlify over GitHub Pages (better features)
2. Chose TinaCMS over Netlify CMS (not deprecated)
3. Using content JSON files for easy editing
4. Tailwind CSS v3 (not v4 - had compatibility issues)

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

None currently. All console errors fixed.

---

## 💡 Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Netlify CMS** - Deprecated, abandoned
2. **Contentful/Sanity** - Too complex for simple site
3. **WordPress** - Monthly costs, overkill
4. **Google Docs + Scripts** - Requires custom coding
5. **Direct JSON editing in GitHub** - Works but not as user-friendly

**Final Choice:** TinaCMS - Best balance of simplicity and features
